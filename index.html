    <div id="section1">
      <p>When this page loaded, Date.now() was called and returned:</p>
      <p id="nowParagraph1"></p>
      <p>That number of milliseconds is:</p>
      <p id="timeSpanParagraph1"></p>
      <p>That amount of time from midnight January 1, 1970 UTC is:</p>
      <p id="timeUtcParagraph1"></p>

        The time above is in UTC, which is a time standard based on the sun at 0Â° longitude, and not
        adjusted for daylight savings.

      <p>That amount of time from midnight January 1, 1970 UTC is:</p>
